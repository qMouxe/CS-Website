        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Internet</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">The internet is a "network of networks". It is an electronic communications network that connects computers from around the world.</p>
<br>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Server</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">A server is where websites and web pages are stored. Servers are dedicated machines that serve web pages to computers that request them. This can be done with an ordinary computer by installing the necessary software onto it.</p>
<br>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">MAC Address</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">MAC stands for Media Access Control, and the MAC address is given to the NIC when it is first manufactured. Every netowrk hardware device has a unique MAC address.</p>
<br>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Router</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">A router is a device that connects two or more packet-switched networks or subnetworks.
          It serves two primary functions: managing traffic between these networks by forwarding data packets to their intended IP addresses, and allowing multiple devices to
           use the same Internet connection.</p>
<br>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">ISP</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">ISP stands for Internet Service Provider. The ISP will provide a household with access to the internet in return for a subscription plan. The better/faster the connection to the internet it, the more the internet plan will cost. </p>
<br>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Packet</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">A packet is a unit of data that can be sent across a network. It consists of 3 section: a header, a payload and a trailer. The header contains the destination address,
          the originating address, and the packet so that packets can be reordered if packet switching is used. The payload contains the actual data and the trailer contains data that indicates the end of the packet and also a checksum to check that the packet transmitted correctly </p>
<br>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">HTML</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and is the standard markup language for creating web pages on the world wide web. HTML consists of a series of elements, which tell the browser how to display the content. It is also the language used to make this website!</p>
<br>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">DNS</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">DNS stands for Domain Name System, which turns domain names into IP addresses, which browsers use to load internet pages. Every device connected to the internet has its own IP address, which is used by other devices to locate the device. DNS servers make it possible for people to input normal words into their browsers, such as Fortinet.com, without having to keep track of the IP address for every website.</p>
<br>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">NIC</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">NIC stands for Network Interface Card. It is typically a circuit board or chip which is installed on a computer so that it can connect to the internet. Most of the time it is built into the motherboard. </p>
<br>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Cookies</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">Cookies are small files that web servers send to browsers. They can be sent back to the server each time the browser requests a new page. It's a way for a website to remember a user, their preferences and their habits. </p>
<br>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">CSS</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language used to describe how HTML or XML elements are to be displayed on screen or other forms of media.  </p>
<br>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">TCP/IP</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol. They are a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. TCP/IP is also used as a communications protocol in a private computer network. TCP is used for organizing data in a way that ensures the secure transmission between the server and client. It guarantees the integrity of data sent over the network, regardless of the amount.</p>
<br>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">URL</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. The URL contains the name of the protocol needed to access a resource, as well as a resource name. The first part of a URL identifies what protocol to use as the primary access medium. The second part identifies the IP address or domain name, and possibly subdomain where the resource is located.</p>
<br>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Protocol</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">A network protocol is an established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network.</p>
<br>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Hub</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">A hub is the connection point in a computer device where data from many directions converge and are then sent out in many directions to respective devices. A hub may also act as a switch by preventing specific data packets from proceeding to a destination.</p>
<br>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Fibre Optic</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">A fibre optic is a material, in most cases a cable consisting of or using thin flexible fibers with a glass core through which light signals can be sent with very little loss of strength.</p>
<br>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Web Browser</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">A web browser is a software program that allows a user to locate, access, and display web pages. Web browsers are used primarily for displaying and accessing websites on the internet, as well as other content created using languages such as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Extensible Markup Language (XML). Some example of web browsers would be Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Safari</p>
<br>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">HTTP</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is the communications protocol used to connect to Web servers on the Internet or on a local network (intranet). The primary function of HTTP is to establish a connection with the server and send HTML pages back to the user's browser. It is also used to download data from the server either to the browser or to any requesting application that uses HTTP.</p>
<br>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Switch</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">A switch is a high-speed device that receives incoming data packets and redirects them to their destination on a local area network (LAN). A LAN switch operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) or the network layer of the OSI Model and, as such it can support all types of packet protocols. The layer 2 switch is also sometimes called a bridge: its function is to send frames containing data packets between nodes or segments of a network.</p>
<br>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Modem</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">A modem is a network device that both modulates and demodulates analog carrier signals (called sine waves) for encoding and decoding digital information for processing. Modems accomplish both of these tasks simultaneously and, for this reason, the term modem is a combination of "modulate" and "demodulate."</p>
<br>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">HTTPS</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">HTTPS stands for HyperText Transport Protocol Secure. It is a variant of the standard web transfer protocol (HTTP) that adds a layer of security on the data in transit through a secure socket layer (SSL) or transport layer security (TLS) protocol connection. </p>
<br>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">LAN</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">LAN stands for Local Area Network and it is a computer network within a small geographical area such as a home or school. A LAN is composed of inter-connected workstations and personal computers which are each capable of accessing and sharing data and devices, such as printers, scanners and data storage devices, anywhere on the LAN. LANs are characterized by higher communication and data transfer rates and the lack of any need for leased communication lines.</p>
<br>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Client</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">A client is the receiving end of a service or the requestor of a service in a client/server model type of system. The client is most often located on another system or computer, which can be accessed via a network.</p>
<br>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">IP Address</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">IP Address stands for Internet Protocol Address and it is a logical numeric address that is assigned to every single computer, printer, switch, router or any other device that is part of a TCP/IP-based network.</p>
<br>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">WAN</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">WAN stands for Wide Area Network and it is a network that exists over a large-scale geographical area. A WAN connects different smaller networks, including local area networks (LANs) and metro area networks (MANs), so that computers and users in one location can communicate with computers and users in other locations. WAN implementation can be done through either a public transmission system or a private network.</p>

      <div class="ISP" id="ISP">
        <h1 data-aos="zoom-in">ISP</h1>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">The ISP is your internet service provider and their job is to make connecting to the internet for a user possible. Without them, even with all the other networking equipment, you would be unable to connect to the internet.</p>

      <div class="Modem" id="Modem">
        <h1 data-aos="zoom-out">Modem</h1>
        <p data-aos="fade-down">The modem is usually a small box provided by the ISP. It connects your devices to the internet using a wired connection. It gives a stable wired connection, however, it does not provide a wireless connection. If you want WiFi, then you would need both a modem and a router. </p>

        <h1 data-aos="zoom-out">Web Browsers</h1>
        <p data-aos="fade-right">Web browsers actually allow you to browse through the internet. A web browser can locate, access and display any web page across the internet as long they have a URL in an understandable format on your screen. The URL of the destination page act as the traffic directions for the web browser, and the web browser can use IP addresses and other tools to establish these connections. </p>
